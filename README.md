 Real Estate Nearest Neighbors Tool
Overview
This script helps analyze real estate data to find similar properties using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. It also visualizes the results in an interactive 3D plot.

How It Works
Prepares Data: Cleans and processes real estate data, focusing on key features like price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
Finds Neighbors: Identifies properties most similar to a selected one based on scaled features.
Visualizes Results: Displays the query property and its neighbors in an interactive 3D scatter plot.

Customization
Change query_index in the script to analyze a different property.
Adjust num_neighbors to find more or fewer neighbors.
Example Output
Console: Shows distances and indices of the nearest neighbors.
3D Plot: Highlights the query property and neighbors interactively.
